# GitHub Gallery

[Demo](http://lthr.io/github-gallery/)

GitHub Gallery is a simple photo gallery, which simply displays all the images it finds in the /images/ folder. It's powered by the Jekyll blog engine, and will work on any such powered pages, for example [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Setting up
Simply clone this repository and push it to your own GitHub account. Also, see GitHub's [Creating project pages manually](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually/) for details.
